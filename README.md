# Sound-Manipulation-C
This repostory contains 2 C programs. Both of these programs work with .wav files. The first program (remvocals.c) works to remove the vocals in an audoio file (.wav) and writes the manipulated audio in a destination file. Once the program has been compiled it should be called as ./remvocals [sourcefile] [destinatinofile]. The second program adds an echo to an audio file. On the program (addecho) has been compiled, it should be called as ./addecho -d [delay] -v [volume scale] [sourcefile] [destinatinofile]. The delay paramter is the ammount the program waits before adding the echo into the file and the volume scale paramter is the ammount the program scales the volume in the oriignal file by to add the echo.
